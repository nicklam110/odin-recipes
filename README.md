Demonstrating foundational HTML knowledge by creating a simple HTML website.

This HTML site is a recipe website that contains a main index page and 
 has links to a few recipes


This project helped reinforce the barebones of HTML. I was able to demonstrate recreating the standard HTML boilerplate.
I was also able to reinforce my knowledge on links, images, lists, and formatting.
